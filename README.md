# Fragment AS Reboot
 This is a full reboot of the .Hack//Fragment Area Server... With the aim of create a uncapped root town that handles area instances for parties of 3 through a subserver architecture... and impliment admin functions beyond kick/ban as no such functions where originally implemented on the AS.

 ## TODO
 1. Make Window to mimic Official AS (doesnt have to be exact).
 2. Get Area Server to List on Lobby Server (Official AS Ip: "a.dothackers.org")
 3. Handle Inbound Connections
 4. Uncapped Root Town + Instanced Dungeons

 ## Known Information
 1. The lobby server hosts it's own webAPI that acts as a middle man for all interserver or clinet/server interactions.
 2. https://www.dothackers.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=17240 (some very useful information on the networking side of things)
